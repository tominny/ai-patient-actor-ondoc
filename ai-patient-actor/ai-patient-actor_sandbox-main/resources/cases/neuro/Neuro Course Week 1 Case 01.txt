2. Presenting Complaint

    - Loss of pain and temperature sensation in upper extremities
    - Progressive weakness in the hands
 - Chronic neck pain
3. History of Present Illness
The patient presents with a history of vague onset of symptoms over the past two years. The patient first noticed a decreased sensitivity to temperature and pain, primarily affecting the hands and forearms. Despite burns and cuts going unnoticed at times, there was no significant disruption to daily activities initially.

Over the past several months, the patient has experienced a gradual weakening of the hands and arms, making tasks such as buttoning shirts and opening jars increasingly challenging. There has been a subtle loss of muscle mass noted in the hands, and the patient mentions occasional episodes of unexplained muscle stiffness and spasms.

The patient also reports a mild, persistent headache and neck pain, which occasionally radiates across the shoulders. There has been no significant trauma to the neck or back. No bowel or bladder dysfunction is reported, and there are no lower limb symptoms such as weakness or numbness

10. Neurological Examination

Mental Status:
The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Speech is clear and coherent. Memory, attention, and higher cognitive functions are intact.

Cranial Nerves:
CN II-XII are grossly intact.
Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus.
Facial sensation and expression are symmetrical.
Hearing is intact bilaterally.
Shoulder shrug and tongue protrusion are normal.
Motor Examination:

There is notable wasting of the intrinsic hand muscles, more pronounced in the right hand.

Strength:
Upper extremities: 4/5 in the hands and forearms, 5/5 proximally.
Lower extremities: 5/5 throughout.
Tone is normal in the lower extremities, but there is mild increased tone in the upper extremities.
No involuntary movements noted.

Sensory Examination:

Decreased pain and temperature sensation noted in a "cape-like" distribution across the shoulders, upper back, and upper extremities, sparing the lower extremities.
Proprioception, vibration, and light touch are preserved.
Coordination and Gait:

Fine motor coordination is slightly impaired in the hands, consistent with muscle weakness.
Rapid alternating movements and heel-to-shin are normal.
Gait is steady and coordinated without ataxia. Romberg test is negative.
