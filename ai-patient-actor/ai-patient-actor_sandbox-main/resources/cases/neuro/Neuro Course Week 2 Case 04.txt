Diagnosis: Right MCS stroke selectively affetcing the motor cortex 

1. Patient Demographics
Name: Jonathan Carter
Age: 65
Sex: Male
Occupation: Retired School Principal

2. Presenting Complaint
Sudden onset of left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking.

3. History of Present Illness
Jonathan woke up this morning with noticeable weakness in his left arm and leg. The symptoms appeared suddenly, about 30 minutes before his wife called emergency services.

4. Past Medical History
Hypertension, hyperlipidemia.

5. Medications and Allergies
Medications: Lisinopril, atorvastatin.
Allergies: No known drug allergies.

6. Family History
Father had a stroke at age 70.

7. Social History
Non-smoker, occasional alcohol, lives with wife, recently retired.

8. Review of Systems
General: No weight loss, fever, or chills.
Cardiovascular: History of hypertension.
Neurological: No previous history of neurological symptoms or seizures.

9. Physical Examination
Vital Signs: BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 78 bpm, RR 16 breaths/min, Temp 98.6°F (37°C).
General: Awake, alert, appears anxious.
HEENT: Pupils equal, round, reactive to light. No nystagmus.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft, non-distended, non-tender.
Extremities: No edema, normal pulses.

10. Neurological Examination
Mental Status: Alert, oriented to person and place, not time; fluent speec
Cranial Nerves: Normal.
Motor: Pronounced weakness in the left upper and lower extremities with muscle strength 2/5; right side is 5/5.
Sensory: Intact to light touch, pain, and temperature bilaterally.
Reflexes: Brisk deep tendon reflexes on the left side; Babinski sign present on the left.
Coordination: Unable to assess finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin due to weakness on the left.
Gait: Unable to walk due to weakness.

11. Diagnostic Tests

Non-contrast CT scan of the head reveals a region of hypodensity in the right motor cortex, suggestive of an ischemic stroke.
MRI of the brain confirms acute ischemic stroke in the right motor cortex.
Carotid duplex ultrasound shows moderate atherosclerosis without significant stenosis.
ECG shows normal sinus rhythm.

12. Differential Diagnosis

Ischemic stroke (highly likely given sudden onset and CT/MRI findings).
Hemorrhagic stroke (less likely given the CT findings).
Brain tumor (unlikely given the acute presentation and imaging results).
Complex migraine (unlikely due to the patient's age and lack of headache).
13. Questions for Discussions About the Case for a 2nd Year Medical Student

What is the clinical significance of a stroke affecting the motor cortex?
How does the side of the brain affected by the stroke relate to the side of the body experiencing symptoms?
Why is it important to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke?
What are the acute management steps for a patient presenting with signs of stroke?
14. Discussion and Teaching Points

Strokes affecting the motor cortex result in contralateral weakness due to the crossing of the motor tracts at the level of the medulla.
Early use of imaging (CT, MRI) is crucial for distinguishing between ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, as treatment differs significantly.
The importance of the 'time is brain' concept where rapid treatment can significantly improve outcomes in stroke.
The role of risk factor management in secondary stroke prevention, including control of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and lifestyle modification.
