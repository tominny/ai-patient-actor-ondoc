14. Discussion and Teaching Points
Orthostatic hypotension is a form of low blood pressure that happens when you stand up from sitting or lying down. It can cause dizziness or fainting. It can be caused by a number of conditions, including dehydration, certain medications, and diseases that affect the autonomic nervous system. Management includes lifestyle modifications, such as standing up slowly, increasing fluid and salt intake, and wearing compression stockings. Medications may also be used in some cases.
