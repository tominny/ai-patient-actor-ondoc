Diagnosis: Left Internal Capsule Stroke
Patient Demographics

Name: John Hopkins
Age: 62 years
Sex: Male
Occupation: Retired military officer
Presenting Complaint

Acute onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking that started 3 hours ago.
History of Present Illness

Mr. Hopkins experienced sudden onset of right-sided weakness while reading a book. Alongside the weakness, he developed slurred speech without any preceding headache, trauma, or illness. He was able to call emergency services and was brought to the hospital by ambulance.

Hypertension, controlled with medication.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, diet-controlled.
No known surgical history.
Medications and Allergies

Medications: Lisinopril 10 mg daily.
No known drug allergies.
Family History

Father had a stroke at age 70.
Mother has a history of atrial fibrillation.
Social History

Denies tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use.
Lives alone; retired, but active in community volunteering.
Review of Systems

General: No weight loss, fever, or chills.
Cardiovascular: No chest pain or palpitations.
Respiratory: No shortness of breath.
Gastrointestinal: No abdominal pain or changes in bowel habits.
Musculoskeletal: Chronic mild lower back pain, no recent trauma.
Physical Examination

Vital Signs: BP 165/90 mmHg, HR 78 bpm, RR 16/min, Temp 98.6Â°F.
General: Awake, alert, and oriented to person and place, but not time.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft, non-distended, non-tender, no organomegaly.
Neurological Examination

Mental Status: Alert, aphasia present with impaired repetition and naming.
Cranial Nerves: Left gaze preference, right facial droop, and dysarthria.
Motor: Right-sided hemiparesis with grade 3/5 strength in the upper and lower extremities.
Sensory: Decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick on the right side.
Coordination: Unable to assess due to weakness.
Gait: Unable to walk due to weakness.
Reflexes: Right-sided hyperreflexia with a positive Babinski sign on the right.
Diagnostic Tests

CT scan of the head without contrast: Showed a hyperdense artery sign suggesting acute left internal capsule infarct.
MRI of the brain with DWI sequence: Confirmed acute infarct in the left internal capsule.
Carotid Doppler: No significant stenosis.
Echocardiogram: Normal left ventricular function without clots or vegetations.
Differential Diagnosis

Primary: Ischemic stroke.
Secondary: Hemorrhagic stroke, brain tumor, demyelinating disease.
Questions for Discussion

What are the vascular territories affected in an internal capsule stroke?
Discuss the management of acute ischemic stroke.
How does hypertension contribute to the risk of stroke?
Discussion and Teaching Points

The internal capsule is supplied by deep penetrating branches of the middle cerebral artery; occlusion can lead to a contralateral hemiplegia and sensory deficit.
Management includes immediate assessment with CT or MRI, possible thrombolytic therapy if within the therapeutic window, and secondary prevention.
Hypertension is a significant modifiable risk factor for stroke. Long-standing hypertension can lead to small vessel disease, which can result in lacunar infarcts such as those affecting the internal capsule.
