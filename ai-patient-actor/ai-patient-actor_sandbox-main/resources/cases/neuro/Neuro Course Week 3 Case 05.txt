Diagnosis: Cerebellar ataxia due to alcoholism
1. Patient Demographics:
Name: Robert Clarkson
Age: 52 years
Sex: Male
Occupation: Former construction worker

2. Presenting Complaint:
Difficulties with balance, coordination, and slurred speech over the past year.

3. History of Present Illness:
Robert has experienced progressive unsteadiness while walking, frequent falls, and noticeable changes in his speech. Symptoms worsened over the last three months.

4. Past Medical History:
Chronic alcoholism, hypertension.

5. Medications and Allergies:
Currently on Atenolol for hypertension. No known allergies.

6. Family History:
Non-contributory.

7. Social History:
Acknowledges heavy alcohol use for over 30 years. Recently unemployed and living alone.

8. Review of Systems:
Denies headache, sensory deficits, or bowel and bladder disturbances. Reports weight loss and general weakness.

9. Physical Examination:
General: Mildly disheveled appearance, malnourished.
Vital Signs: BP 140/90, HR 85, RR 16, Temp 98.6 F.
Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, no murmurs.
Respiratory: Clear to auscultation.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no hepatomegaly.

10. Neurological Examination:
Mental Status: Alert, oriented to person and place but not time.
Cranial Nerves: Dysarthric speech. Otherwise, CN II-XII are grossly intact.
Motor: No focal weakness.
Cerebellar: Dysdiadochokinesia, intention tremor, and past-pointing present bilaterally, worse on the right.
Gait: Broad-based and ataxic, unable to walk heel-to-toe.
Reflexes: Symmetrical, normal.
Sensation: Intact to light touch, vibration, and proprioception.
Coordination: Severely impaired with the finger-to-nose and heel-shin tests.

11. Diagnostic Tests:

Blood tests: Elevated liver enzymes, macrocytic anemia.
MRI of the brain: Atrophy of the cerebellum, especially the vermis.
Thiamine levels: Below normal range.
12. Differential Diagnosis:

Alcoholic cerebellar degeneration
Multiple system atrophy
Cerebellar stroke
Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration
13. Questions for Discussions:

How do the symptoms and history of alcohol abuse correlate with cerebellar ataxia?
Why is thiamine deficiency relevant in this case?
What are the potential reversible factors in this case?
14. Discussion and Teaching Points:

Cerebellar ataxia in alcoholism is often due to direct toxic effects and nutritional deficiencies, especially thiamine.
Chronic alcoholism can lead to characteristic cerebellar degeneration, particularly in the anterior superior vermis.
Management includes abstinence from alcohol, nutritional support, and physical therapy.
