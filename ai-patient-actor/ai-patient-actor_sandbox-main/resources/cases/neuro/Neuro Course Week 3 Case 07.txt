4. Past Medical History:
Hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia.

5. Medications and Allergies:

6. Family History:
No known family history of Parkinson’s disease or other neurological conditions.

7. Social History:
Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use. Lives with his spouse. Active in the community and enjoys playing chess.

9. Physical Examination:
General: Alert, well-oriented in time, place, and person.
Vital Signs: BP 128/78, HR 70, RR 16, Temp 98.6 F.
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender.

10. Neurological Examination:
Mental Status: Intact cognitive function.
Cranial Nerves: Intact.

MRI Brain may be used to rule out other conditions; typically normal in Parkinson's disease but may show nonspecific changes.
12. Differential Diagnosis:

Parkinson’s disease
Essential tremor
Drug-induced parkinsonism
Multiple system atrophy
13. Questions for Discussions:

What are the cardinal signs of Parkinson’s disease?
How does one differentiate between Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor?
What is the role of imaging in the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease?
14. Discussion and Teaching Points:

Parkinson’s disease is characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability.
Differentiating Parkinson’s disease from other parkinsonian syndromes is crucial for management.
Treatment is symptomatic, with levodopa being the cornerstone of therapy.
