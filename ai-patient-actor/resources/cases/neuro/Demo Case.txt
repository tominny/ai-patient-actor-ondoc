1. Case Title	A Comprehensive Study of Mild Alzheimer's Disease: Mrs. Abiagil Smith
2. Patient Demographics	- Name: Mrs. Jane Smith (pseudonym) <br> - Age: 72 <br> - Sex: Female <br> - Occupation: Retired high school English teacher for 35 years. Graduated with a Master's in English Literature.
3. Presenting Complaint	Difficulty remembering recent events such as family gatherings, consistently misplacing household items like her reading glasses and car keys, and occasionally forgetting names of close friends during conversations.
4. History of Present Illness	Mrs. Smith first noticed minor forgetfulness approximately 18 months ago. Initially, she would forget where she placed common items or the names of less familiar acquaintances. Over the past six months, these episodes became more frequent. She started having difficulty recalling details of conversations from the previous day and began to repeat questions during family dinners. Her daughter noticed she missed paying some monthly bills.
5. Past Medical History	Managed hypertension for 10 years, treated with Amlodipine. Diagnosed with osteoporosis 5 years ago, following a minor wrist fracture. Underwent a hysterectomy at age 45 due to fibroids. No history of smoking or alcohol abuse. Routine vaccinations up-to-date.
6. Medications and Allergies	- Current Medications: Amlodipine 5mg daily for hypertension, Alendronate 70mg weekly for osteoporosis, Multivitamin daily, Over-the-counter fish oil capsules for heart health. <br> - Known Allergies: Penicillin causes a rash and swelling of the lips.
7. Family History	Mother diagnosed with dementia in her late 70s, managed with Donepezil, and passed away at 85. Father had coronary artery disease, managed with aspirin and statins, and passed away from a heart attack at 73. One younger brother, aged 68, diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, managed with Metformin.
8. Social History	Mrs. Smith has been a non-smoker throughout her life. She drinks a glass of red wine with dinner 2-3 times a week. She lives with her husband of 50 years in a two-story home. They have two adult children and four grandchildren. Mrs. Smith attends a book club monthly, is an active member of her local church, and used to enjoy gardening, but has found it increasingly challenging to keep track of her plants' needs.
9. Review of Systems	She reports occasional word-finding difficulty, especially with names. She also notes some difficulty navigating to unfamiliar places, having gotten lost driving to a new grocery store recently. Sleep pattern is slightly disturbed, waking up 2-3 times a night, but she can return to sleep. Denies any symptoms of depression, but feels slightly anxious about her memory lapses. Appetite is good, but she has lost 5 pounds over the past year without trying. No changes in vision or hearing. No muscle weakness or numbness. Bowel and bladder functions are normal.
10. Physical Examination	Vital Signs: BP: 130/85 mmHg, HR: 78 bpm, RR: 16/min, Temp: 98.6Â°F, SpO2: 98% on room air.
11. Neurological Examination	Mental Status: MMSE score of 24/30; she lost points on recall, attention, and orientation to date. <br> - Cranial Nerves: Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular movements intact. Facial sensation and strength preserved. Hearing intact bilaterally. Tongue midline. <br> - Motor Examination: Normal strength (5/5) in all extremities. No involuntary movements. <br> - Sensory Examination: Intact to light touch, vibration, and proprioception throughout. No sensory deficits. <br> - Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric at biceps, triceps, patella, and Achilles. Plantar reflexes are flexor. <br> - Coordination and Gait: Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin tests are normal. Normal base gait, but shows mild difficulty with tandem walking and a slight hesitation turning.
12. Diagnostic Studies and Results	Neuropsychological Testing: <br> - General Intellectual Function: The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) showed a Full Scale IQ in the average range but was significantly lower than expected based on her educational and occupational background. <br> - Memory Assessment: On the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), Mrs. Smith demonstrated significant difficulties with immediate and delayed recall, particularly for list-learning tasks. Her recognition was relatively preserved, but she showed a susceptibility to false positives. The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test indicated impaired visual memory, especially on delayed recall. <br> - Executive Functions: The Trail Making Test (Part B) was completed with difficulty and increased time. On the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, she showed difficulties with maintaining set and exhibited perseverative errors. <br> - Language Functions: The Boston Naming Test indicated occasional word-finding difficulties, but fluency tasks were within normal limits. <br> - Attention and Working Memory: Digit span tasks (forward and backward) from the WAIS-IV were below average. <br> - Visual-Spatial Skills: The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure copy task was completed adequately but with minor distortions. <br> - Mood Assessment: The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were within normal limits. <br> MRI brain: Mild diffuse cortical atrophy with pronounced atrophy in the medial temporal lobe regions. Laboratory tests: CBC, CMP, TSH, Vitamin B12, Folate, and RPR all within normal limits. ApoE genotyping showed she is ApoE3/ApoE4 carrier.
13. Clinical Question(s) for Discussion	Given the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, how confident are we in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease? How does the ApoE genotype correlate with her risk? What are the implications of the MRI findings in terms of disease progression and prognosis? What pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions should be considered?
14. Discussion and Teaching Points	Emphasize the importance of early and accurate diagnosis in Alzheimer's disease, the role of genetics (ApoE genotyping), and the significance of imaging findings. Discuss potential pharmacological interventions, including cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists, as well as non-pharmacological interventions such as cognitive therapy, exercise
