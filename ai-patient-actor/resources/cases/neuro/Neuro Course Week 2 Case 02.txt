Diagnosis: Diabetic neuropathy

1. Patient Demographics
Name: Johnathan Goodwin
Age: 58
Sex: Male
Occupation: Accountant

2. Presenting Complaint
Numbness and tingling in both feet, difficulty with fine motor skills in hands.

3. History of Present Illness
Johnathan reports a progressive onset of numbness and tingling in his toes extending upward to his ankles over the past 6 months. He also mentions "burning" sensations at night. Recently, he’s been dropping objects and having trouble buttoning his shirts.

4. Past Medical History
Type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 8 years ago, hypertension, hyperlipidemia.

5. Medications and Allergies
Medications: Metformin, lisinopril, atorvastatin.
Allergies: No known drug allergies.

6. Family History
Father had type 2 diabetes mellitus, died of a stroke. Mother is healthy. One sibling with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

7. Social History
Smokes half a pack of cigarettes per day for 30 years. Drinks alcohol socially. Married with two children.

8. Review of Systems
General: Weight stable, no fevers or chills.
HEENT: No vision or hearing changes.
Cardiovascular: No chest pain or palpitations.
Respiratory: No shortness of breath.
GI: Normal appetite, occasional constipation.
GU: No change in urinary frequency or urgency.
Musculoskeletal: Denies joint pain or muscle aches.
Integumentary: Reports foot ulcers in the past.
Neurological: As per HPI; no dizziness, no headaches.

9. Physical Examination
Vital Signs: Blood pressure 145/90 mmHg, heart rate 82 bpm, respiratory rate 14 breaths/min, BMI 32 kg/m^2.
General: Well-nourished, well-kept male in no acute distress.
Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, no murmurs.
Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no masses.
Extremities: No cyanosis, no edema, noted calluses on the soles of the feet.

10. Neurological Examination
Mental Status: Alert and oriented x3.
Cranial Nerves: II-XII intact.
Motor: Strength 5/5 in all major muscle groups proximally and distally.
Sensory: Decreased sensation to light touch, vibration, and temperature in a stocking distribution; proprioception intact.
Coordination: Intact, but patient has difficulty with heel-to-shin test.
Gait: Normal.
Reflexes: Ankle reflexes are absent; knee reflexes are reduced; upper extremity reflexes are normal.

11. Diagnostic Test

Nerve conduction studies and electromyography (EMG) show slowed conduction velocities and reduced amplitude in the peripheral nerves, consistent with a sensorimotor polyneuropathy.
HbA1c is 8.2%, indicating less than optimal glycemic control.
12. Differential Diagnosis

Diabetic neuropathy (most likely given the history and examination findings)
Vitamin B12 deficiency neuropathy
Alcoholic neuropathy
Hypothyroidism-related neuropathy
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)
13. Questions for Discussions About the Case for a 2nd Year Medical Student

What features of the patient’s history and physical exam support a diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy?
How does the pathophysiology of diabetes contribute to neuropathy?
What could be the reason for the patient’s nocturnal symptoms worsening?
How might you distinguish diabetic neuropathy from other types of polyneuropathy?
What management strategies might improve this patient’s symptoms and quality of life?
14. Discussion and Teaching Points

Diabetic neuropathy often presents with a "stocking-glove" pattern of sensory loss and may include motor involvement.
Chronic hyperglycemia leads to glycation of nerve proteins and blood vessels, impairing nerve function and blood supply.
Nocturnal pain can be exacerbated by the lack of distraction from the pain that occurs during the day.
Vitamin B12 deficiency, alcohol use, and other causes of neuropathy can be differentiated by history, examination, and specific laboratory tests.
Tight glycemic control, smoking cessation, foot care, pain management, and potentially the use of medications like pregabalin or gabapentin can help manage symptoms.
