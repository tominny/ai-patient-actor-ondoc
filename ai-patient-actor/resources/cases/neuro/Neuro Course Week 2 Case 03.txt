Diagnosis: Guillian-Barre Syndrome

1. Patient Demographics
Name: Michael Thompson
Age: 42
Sex: Male
Occupation: Graphic Designer

2. Presenting Complaint
Acute onset of weakness in the legs, ascending to the upper limbs, and difficulty breathing.

3. History of Present Illness
Michael reports that over the past week, he has experienced progressive weakness beginning in his lower extremities, now involving his upper extremities. Initially, he noticed difficulty when climbing stairs, which has progressed to difficulty walking. Today, he has started to feel shortness of breath and trouble gripping objects.

4. Past Medical History
Unremarkable.

5. Medications and Allergies
No regular medications.
Allergies: Penicillin causes rash.

6. Family History
No known family history of neurological disorders.

7. Social History
Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use. No recreational drug use. Lives with his wife and one child.

8. Review of Systems
Positive for recent upper respiratory tract infection 2 weeks ago, resolved without treatment. Denies fever, headache, bowel/bladder dysfunction, or recent vaccinations.

9. Physical Examination
Vital Signs: BP 130/75 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 18 breaths/min, afebrile.
General: Awake, alert, and oriented x3.
Cardiovascular: S1 and S2 normal, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Respiratory: Effortful breathing, no wheezes, crackles, or stridor.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities: No edema or rash, mild bilateral pedal pitting edema.

10. Neurological Examination
Mental Status: Intact, no apparent cognitive deficits.
Cranial Nerves: II-XII grossly intact, but patient reports difficulty swallowing.
Motor: Symmetric proximal and distal weakness more pronounced in lower extremities, 3/5 strength in hip flexors and knee extensors, 4/5 in upper extremities.
Sensory: Intact to light touch and pinprick; however, reports tingling sensations in extremities.
Reflexes: Diminished (1+) in biceps, triceps, brachioradialis. Absent ankle reflex.
Coordination: Unable to perform heel-to-shin and finger-to-nose tests due to weakness.
Gait: Unable to assess due to weakness.

11. Diagnostic Test

Lumbar puncture showing albuminocytologic dissociation with elevated protein and normal white cell count.
Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) showing slowed conduction velocities and prolonged distal latencies.
Pulmonary function tests show reduced forced vital capacity, indicating respiratory muscle involvement.
12. Differential Diagnosis

Guillain-Barré syndrome (likely given the clinical presentation and CSF findings).
Myasthenia gravis (less likely, given the absence of ocular symptoms and the progression pattern).
Poliomyelitis (unlikely in vaccinated populations and absence of fecal-oral transmission history).
Transverse myelitis (does not typically present with ascending paralysis and would have different CSF findings).
13. Questions for Discussions About the Case for a 2nd Year Medical Student

What are the classic clinical features of Guillain-Barré syndrome?
Why is albuminocytologic dissociation significant in Guillain-Barré syndrome?
How would you manage a patient with Guillain-Barré syndrome, particularly with respiratory involvement?
What is the typical progression of Guillain-Barré syndrome, and how does it inform your monitoring and management of the patient?
14. Discussion and Teaching Points

Guillain-Barré syndrome is characterized by rapid-onset muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system.
The typical pattern is ascending paralysis, starting from the feet and moving upwards.
Albuminocytologic dissociation is a hallmark CSF finding indicative of the disease and results from the immune attack on nerve roots and peripheral nerves.
Management includes monitoring respiratory function, plasmapheresis or IVIG treatment, and supportive care.
Early identification and treatment are crucial for a favorable outcome, and patients should be monitored for autonomic dysfunction and other complications.
