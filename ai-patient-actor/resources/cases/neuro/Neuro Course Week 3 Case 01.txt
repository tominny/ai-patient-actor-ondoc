Diagnosis: Horner Syndrome

1. Patient Demographics
Name: Jonathan Carter
Age: 45
Sex: Male
Occupation: Accountant

2. Presenting Complaint
Jonathan reports noticing that his left eyelid has been drooping and his left pupil appears smaller than the right.

3. History of Present Illness
The patient noticed the changes to his eye about two weeks ago. Initially, he thought it was due to fatigue, but the asymmetry did not resolve. He denies any pain, vision changes, or recent trauma.

4. Past Medical History
Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia.

5. Medications and Allergies
Medications: Amlodipine, Atorvastatin.
Allergies: No known drug allergies.

6. Family History
Father had a myocardial infarction at age 50, mother has type 2 diabetes.

7. Social History
Smokes half a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 20 years, socially drinks alcohol.

8. Review of Systems
Denies headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or any neurologic symptoms such as weakness or numbness.

9. Physical Examination
Vital Signs: BP 135/85 mmHg, HR 76 bpm, RR 16 breaths/min, Temp 98.6°F (37°C).
General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress.
HEENT: Left ptosis and miosis, anhidrosis on the left side of the face. Right eye normal.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs or gallops.
Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, normoactive bowel sounds.

10. Neurological Examination
Mental Status: Normal, no evidence of cognitive impairment.
Cranial Nerves:

Ptosis of the left upper eyelid (mild), pupil size difference > 1mm with the left pupil being smaller.
No anisocoria noted in dark (pupils equalize in darkness).
Rest of cranial nerves intact.
Motor: Strength 5/5 in all four extremities.
Sensory: Intact to light touch, vibration, and proprioception.
Reflexes: Brisk, symmetrical.
Coordination: No dysmetria on finger-to-nose or heel-to-shin testing.
Gait: Normal.
11. Diagnostic Tests
CT Chest: No evidence of apical lung tumors (i.e., no Pancoast tumor identified). The mediastinum is unremarkable without lymphadenopathy or masses.

MRI/MRA Head and Neck: MRI of the brain and brainstem is normal without evidence of stroke or mass lesion. MRA does not show any aneurysm or dissection of the carotid arteries.

Carotid Ultrasound: Reveals no signs of carotid dissection or significant atherosclerotic disease.

Cocaine Drop Test: Application of cocaine eye drops to both eyes does not lead to dilation of the left pupil, confirming denervation hypersensitivity and suggesting that the postganglionic sympathetic fibers are intact. 

Apraclonidine Test: Administration of apraclonidine drops leads to reversal of ptosis and mydriasis in the affected eye, which is diagnostic for postganglionic Horner Syndrome.

Blood Tests: Complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein levels are within normal limits, which helps rule out inflammatory or infectious processes.

Chest X-ray: Shows clear lungs and no abnormalities in the thoracic cavity.

12. Differential Diagnosis

Horner Syndrome due to carotid dissection.
Horner Syndrome due to a Pancoast tumor.
Horner Syndrome secondary to other thoracic lesions or neck trauma.
Cluster headaches (typically present with a Horner Syndrome during the acute phase).
Idiopathic if no cause is found after extensive evaluation.

13. Questions for discussions about the case for a 2nd year medical student

What is the anatomical pathway of the sympathetic fibers that when disrupted can lead to Horner Syndrome?
What are the clinical features of Horner Syndrome and why do they present in this manner?
What is the significance of the absence of anisocoria in darkness in a patient with Horner Syndrome?
What are the potential life-threatening causes of Horner Syndrome?
14. Discussion and Teaching Points

Horner Syndrome is characterized by ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis, which result from the disruption of the sympathetic pathways.
It's important to evaluate for potentially life-threatening causes of Horner Syndrome, such as carotid dissection or a Pancoast tumor.
The absence of anisocoria in darkness is indicative of Horner Syndrome because the normal eye has a delayed dilation due to the lack of sympathetic innervation to the affected eye.
A systematic approach to imaging based on suspected etiology is important for efficient and effective diagnosis.
