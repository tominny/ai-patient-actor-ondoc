Diagnosis: Multiple System Atrophy

1. Patient Demographics
Patient Name: William Thomas
Age: 62
Sex: Male
Occupation: Retired Engineer

2. Presenting Complaint
The patient presents with a 2-year history of progressive difficulty with balance, slurred speech, and urinary incontinence.

3. History of Present Illness
John first noticed difficulty with balance about two years ago, which has progressively worsened. He reports frequent falls, especially when turning. He also noticed changes in his speech, described as slurred and slow. Over the past six months, he has experienced urinary incontinence, which is distressing for him. He denies any significant weight loss, fever, or other systemic symptoms.

4. Past Medical History
John has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has no history of stroke, seizures, or other neurological disorders.

5. Medications and Allergies
John is currently on Lisinopril for hypertension and Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. He has no known drug allergies.

6. Family History
There is no family history of neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease, or other neurological disorders.

7. Social History
John is a retired engineer, living with his wife. He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally.

8. Review of Systems
John reports no changes in vision, hearing, or smell. He denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or gastrointestinal symptoms.

9. Physical Examination
John appears well-nourished and well-kept. Vital signs are stable. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations are unremarkable. Abdominal examination reveals no abnormalities. Musculoskeletal examination shows normal muscle bulk and tone.

10. Neurological Examination
John has a broad-based, unstable gait with a tendency to fall backwards. His speech is slow and slurred. Cranial nerve examination is normal. Motor examination shows normal strength and tone in all four limbs. Sensory examination is normal. Deep tendon reflexes are brisk. There is no tremor or rigidity. Coordination tests reveal a mild intention tremor.

11. Diagnostic Tests
MRI of the brain shows atrophy of the pons and cerebellum, with the "hot cross bun" sign. Autonomic function tests, including tilt-table test, Valsalva maneuver, and quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test (QSART), show severe autonomic dysfunction. The tilt-table test reveals orthostatic hypotension. The Valsalva maneuver shows an abnormal response with a lack of the expected rise and fall in blood pressure. QSART shows decreased or absent sweat output. Urodynamic studies reveal detrusor hyperreflexia.

12. Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis includes Parkinson's disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, and Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus.

13. Questions for discussions about the case for a 2nd year medical student
- What are the key clinical features of Multiple System Atrophy?
- How does Multiple System Atrophy differ from Parkinson's disease?
- What is the significance of the "hot cross bun" sign on MRI?

14. Discussion and Teaching Points
Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) is a rare, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a combination of symptoms that affect both the autonomic system (such as blood pressure control and bladder function) and movement. The key clinical features include autonomic dysfunction, parkinsonism, and cerebellar ataxia. The "hot cross bun" sign on MRI is a characteristic finding in MSA, representing atrophy and gliosis in the pons. Management is largely supportive as there is currently no cure for MSA
