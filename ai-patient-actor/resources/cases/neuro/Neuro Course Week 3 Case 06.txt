Age: 63 years
Sex: Male
Occupation: Retired postal worker

2. Presenting Complaint:

4. Past Medical History:
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia.

5. Medications and Allergies:

8. Review of Systems:
Denies headache, chest pain, shortness of breath. No recent illness or fever.

9. Physical Examination:
General: Awake, alert, and oriented. Involuntary movements noted on the left side.
Vital Signs: BP 145/85, HR 78, RR 14, Temp 97.8 F.
HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, oropharynx clear.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, no organomegaly.

10. Neurological Examination:
Mental Status: Intact.
Cranial Nerves: II-XII intact.
Motor: Normal tone and bulk on the right, involuntary ballistic movements on the left.
Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric, Babinski negative bilaterally.
Sensation: Intact to light touch, pain, temperature, vibration, and proprioception throughout.
Coordination: Unable to assess coordination on the left due to hemiballismus. Right coordination is normal.
Gait: Unable to walk due to the severity of movements.

11. Diagnostic Tests:

Blood tests: HbA1c elevated, other labs within normal limits.
CT head without contrast: Hyperdense lesion in the right basal ganglia.
MRI Brain shows lesion in the right subthalamic nucleus.
12. Differential Diagnosis:

Stroke causing hemiballismus
Hyperglycemia-induced hemiballismus
Drug-induced movement disorder
Huntington's disease
13. Questions for Discussions:

What is the pathophysiology of hemiballism?
How does the location of the lesion correlate with the presentation?
What other conditions can mimic hemiballism?
14. Discussion and Teaching Points:

Hemiballismus is typically caused by lesions in the subthalamic nucleus or its connections.
Control of blood sugar is important in diabetic patients with hemiballismus.
Treatment may involve pharmacotherapy with neuroleptics or anticonvulsants.
