Name: Alexander Clark
Age: 39 years
Sex: Male
Occupation: Software Developer

2. Presenting Complaint:
Involuntary jerking movements, mood swings, and memory lapses noted by family members.

4. Past Medical History:
No significant past medical history. No history of substance abuse or head trauma.

5. Medications and Allergies:
No current medications. No known drug allergies.

Father had a similar neurological condition, diagnosed as Huntington's disease.

7. Social History:
Married with two children. Works as a software developer. Reports social drinking, denies tobacco or illicit drug use.

8. Review of Systems:
Reports weight loss, sleep disturbances, and a decrease in work performance due to cognitive decline.

9. Physical Examination:
General: Appears stated age, well-nourished, and in no acute distress. Involuntary movements noted during the exam.
Vital Signs: BP 130/80, HR 72, RR 16, Temp 98.6 F.
HEENT: Pupils equal, round, reactive to light. Extraocular movements intact, no nystagmus.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no hepatosplenomegaly.

10. Neurological Examination:
Mental Status: Alert but with evident cognitive slowing.

Sensation: Intact to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception.
Coordination: Impaired due to involuntary movements, with difficulty performing rapid alternating movements.

11. Diagnostic Tests:

Genetic testing revealing CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene.
MRI Brain: Atrophy of the caudate nuclei with enlargement of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles.
12. Differential Diagnosis:

Other causes of chorea, such as Sydenham's chorea or drug-induced chorea.
Neuroacanthocytosis.

13. Questions for Discussions:

What are the clinical features that distinguish Huntington's disease from other movement disorders?
How does the family history contribute to the diagnosis?
What is the role of genetic testing in the diagnosis of Huntington's disease?
14. Discussion and Teaching Points:

Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by movement, cognitive, and psychiatric disturbances.
Genetic testing is crucial for the diagnosis and for family planning.
No cure exists; treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
