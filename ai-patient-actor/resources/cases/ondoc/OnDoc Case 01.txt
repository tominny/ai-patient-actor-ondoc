Diagnosis: Community-acquired pneumonia

Patient Demographics Name: 

Jane Doe Age: 58 years old Sex: Female Occupation: Accountant

Presenting Complaint 

Patient presents with a productive cough with yellowish sputum, low-grade fever, and general malaise.

History of Present Illness 

The patient started experiencing a mild cough approximately one week ago, which has progressively worsened. The cough is described as productive with yellowish sputum. Two days ago, she began to notice a low-grade fever fluctuating between 99.5-100.5°F. She denies having any chest pain, shortness of breath, or hemoptysis.

Past Medical History

Hypertension, managed with medication.
No prior surgeries.
No known lung diseases or previous pneumonia.
Medications and Allergies Medications: Lisinopril 10mg/day. Allergies: Penicillin (rash).

Family History 
Mother had COPD, father died of myocardial infarction; no siblings.

Social History 
Patient is a non-smoker, consumes alcohol socially, and denies any recreational drug use. She lives with her husband and has two adult children. She works as an accountant, which recently required her to work longer hours due to tax season.

Review of Systems 
She reports mild fatigue and decreased appetite; denies weight loss. There is no reported dysuria, headache, skin rash, or recent travel.

Physical Examination 
Vitals: BP 140/85 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, T 99.8°F, RR 18 breaths/min, O2 Sat 97% on room air. General: Mildly distress patient, in no acute distress. HEENT: Normocephalic, PERRLA, EOMI, no lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, no peripheral edema. Respiratory: Mild crackles auscultated at the right lower lung base; no wheezes. Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no hepatosplenomegaly. Skin: No rashes or lesions noted.

Neurological Examination Mental status: 
The patient is alert, oriented x3, and speech is clear and coherent. Cranial nerves: II-XII intact. Motor: Normal muscle bulk and tone; 5/5 strength in upper and lower extremities bilaterally. Sensory: Intact to light touch, vibration, and proprioception. Coordination: Finger-nose and heel-shin tests are normal; no dysmetria. Reflexes: +2 throughout, symmetric, plantar reflexes are downgoing. Gait: Steady with no ataxia.

Diagnostic Tests

CBC: Mild leukocytosis with left shift.
CMP: Within normal limits.
Chest X-ray: Blunting of the right costophrenic angle, suggestive of a small pleural effusion.
Sputum culture and sensitivity pending.

Differential Diagnosis

Community-acquired pneumonia
Acute bronchitis
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation
Tuberculosis (less likely due to lack of high-risk factors)

Questions for discussions about the case for a 2nd year medical student

What risk factors contribute to the development of community-acquired pneumonia?
How does the presentation of bacterial pneumonia differ from viral pneumonia?
What is the importance of obtaining a chest X-ray in patients with suspected pneumonia?
How do leukocyte counts with differential contribute to the clinical assessment of potential infectious diseases?
Discuss the rationale for the chosen pharmacotherapy based on the patient’s allergies.

Discussion and Teaching Points

Community-acquired pneumonia often presents with cough, fever, and a focal consolidation on chest X-ray. A productive cough with purulent sputum suggests a bacterial etiology.
Risk factors for pneumonia include advanced age, comorbid diseases such as COPD or diabetes, smoking, and immune-compromised states.
A chest X-ray is critical in identifying areas of consolidation, pleural effusions, and other pathologies such as masses or atelectasis.
Leukocytosis with a left shift typically indicates a bacterial infection, guiding initial empirical antibiotic therapy until culture results are available.
When prescribing antibiotics, it is essential to consider patient-specific factors like allergies to avoid adverse drug reactions
